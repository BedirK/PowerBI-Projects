## Project 02 
## Retail Analysis 
### Data Understanding:
This [dataset](https://github.com/BedirK/PowerBI-Projects/blob/main/Projects/Project02/retail_analysis_data.xlsx) was obtained using sales data from two retail chains based in Australia, with data spanning from January 2016 to July 2017. 
There is a dimension table that categorizes sales data based on the financial year, financial quarter, and financial year month. Additionally, there's detailed information on postcodes, linking to specific suburbs and states. And also categorized buyers for product categories and managers for different suburbs.
### Dashboard Preparation Steps
 - Query Editor to add columns for  calculating total sales, total cost, and gross profit values
 - Power pivot modeling to create relationships between separate tables (Sales and Dates)
 - Selecting visualization types
 - Formatting visual details and report
### Global Perspective - Key Metrics - Insights
The "Summary Dashboard" gives an overall picture of the business units and how they're performing.

- When comparing quarterly performance, Q1 2017 stands out, recording the highest total revenue and significantly outperforming Q1 2018 figures. This quarter also recorded the highest GP%, indicating a robust financial period.
- Ready Wear consistently outperformed Bellings across various metrics, including a significantly higher contribution to Total Sales. 
- Furthermore, the divergence between Total Sales and Gross Profit peaked in Q1 2017, suggesting a significant disconnect between sales and profits.
- Overall, the data highlights the dominance of Total Sales and Gross Profit in Q1 2017, particularly for the ready-wear.
  
The "Regions and Chains" dashboard outputs:

- VIC State experienced a consistent sales rise from January 2016 onwards.
- John Gardner in NSW State played a significant role in ready-wear sales. Ready-wear outperformed Bellings notably in NSW.
- Bruce Curran held the highest sales, marking a substantial portion of total sales, contrasting starkly with Ella Hickman's lower sales contribution.
